# Crop-Yield-Prediction-Using-Python
This project uses linear regression to predict crop yield based on rainfall and fertilizer input. It leverages Python libraries like pandas, scikit-learn, and matplotlib for data processing, model training, and visualization. The results help analyze the impact of inputs on crop yield.
